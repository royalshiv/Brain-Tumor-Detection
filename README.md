# Brain Tumor Detection using Custom CNN, VGG-16, and ResNet-50

This project uses deep learning techniques to detect brain tumors from MRI images. It employs a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning with pre-trained models VGG-16 and ResNet-50 for accurate classification of images into tumor or non-tumor categories.

## Workflow
1. **Dataset**: MRI images classified into tumor and non-tumor categories.
2. **Model Training**:
   - **Custom CNN**: A lightweight, from-scratch model for baseline performance.
   - **VGG-16 & ResNet-50**: Fine-tuned pre-trained models for improved accuracy.
3. **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
