# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project uses deep learning techniques to detect brain tumors from MRI images. It employs a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning with pre-trained models VGG-16 and ResNet-50 for accurate classification of images into tumor or non-tumor categories.
